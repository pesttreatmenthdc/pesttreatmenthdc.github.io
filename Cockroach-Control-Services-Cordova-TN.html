The following are common control alternatives that can be utilized at different stages of crop production to avoid, decrease, or treat pest infestations.

<p>IPM means integrated pest management that integrates a number of tools and techniques. We have actually been in business since 1947, which indicates we understand the pests that prevail to this region and have the knowledge and tools to remove them. To deplore an efficient IPM programme, literature and other data sources about the pest, the pest's life process, host range, distribution, motion, and fundamental biology will need to be looked into.</p>
<p>For that reason, pest management practices on one crop can directly or indirectly affect the other. Pest control is severe business, one that you shouldn't be handling yourself. These are numerous termite control companies, however only HICARE utilizes best-in-class chemicals: HICARE'S TERMIN-8 is a non-repellent chemical that completely kill even the last termite present.</p>
<p>All at once, it is likewise based upon semiochemicals especially kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are repelled or discouraged far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once brought in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ). Most pesticide issues are brought on by a small number of the pesticides available today. </p>

If additional monitoring, identifications and action limits suggest that less risky controls are not working, then extra pest control methods would be used, such as targeted spraying of pesticides. However excellent the results of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) may be, it is just reasonable to state that worldwide, its release in farming is still in its infancy, and we are a long method from understanding whatever that goes on in and around the crops we grow for food.</p>
