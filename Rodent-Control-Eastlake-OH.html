<p>QualityPro is the industry-wide certification program of the National Pest Management Association (NPMA), which increases our level of professionalism through self-regulation. Clearly landscape ecology practices put in a range of preferred or undesired impacts on cropping systems (27 ). Hence, it is crucial that we put together proper teams to elucidate interactions at the ecosystem level to establish the knowledge base for ecologically based pest management systems.</p>
