<p>The decision of the right reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is vital in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides toxic to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than products that are narrow-spectrum or selective for specific insect types or life phases. </p>
<p>Nobody likes pests and bugs whether they are rats, cockroaches, mosquitoes or lizards, flies and bees. Among the most common indoor pests, an ant infestation can be a challenging job to get rid of. Ants live in the smallest of the cracks and are usually discovered inside the walls, cabinets, corners of the wall, and so on Intelligent resistance management will be a key for sustainable usage of GM crops in IPM while there is a need for much better harmonization of GM crops with existing IPM strategies.</p>
