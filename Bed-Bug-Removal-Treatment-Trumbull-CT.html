Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to eliminate pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a holistic method to sustainable crop security that focuses on handling insects, weeds and illness through a combination of cultural, physical, biological and chemical methods that are cost effective, ecologically sound and socially acceptable.</p>
<p>Biological pest control steps take advantage of the hierarchy within nature.
