Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a holistic method to sustainable crop security that focuses on handling insects, weeds and illness through a combination of cultural, physical, biological and chemical methods that are cost effective, ecologically sound and socially acceptable.</p>
<p>Biological pest control steps take advantage of the hierarchy within nature.
